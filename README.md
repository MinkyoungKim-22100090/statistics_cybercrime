1. Title: 
A Quantitative Analysis of Hacking Incident Trends and Resolution Rates

2. Introduction:
This report presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of hacking incidents and their resolution rates. The objective is to decipher the patterns and trends that have emerged over the years and to evaluate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures in place.

3. Rationale for Choosing the Topic and Dataset:
The escalating frequency and diverse nature of cyber threats pose significant challenges to organizations, governments, and individuals. Understanding the trends in hacking incidents and clearance rates is crucial for devising effective cybersecurity strategies. This dataset provides insights into the patterns of hacking incidents, aiding in the identification of vulnerable areas and potential improvement strategies.

4. Beneficiaries and Potential Contributions:
The primary beneficiaries of this research project include cybersecurity professionals, law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and organizations handling sensitive data. Successful analysis of this dataset can contribute to the enhancement of cybersecurity measures. For instance, identifying the most prevalent types of hacking incidents and their clearance rates can guide resource allocation for preventive measures and investigations, ultimately leading to a more secure cyberspace for society.

5. Goals of Statistical Analysis:
The analysis is structured to achieve the following objectives:
1) Identify and analyze the trends of different hacking incidents over the years.
2) Investigate the correlation between the occurrences of hacking incidents and their clearance rates.
3) Utilize statistical models to evaluate the arrest rates for various hacking incidents.

6. Data Source and Strengths/Weaknesses:
The data was provided by a public data portal and contains official statistics collected by government agencies. The biggest strength of this dataset lies in its accuracy and public confidence. Since public data portals are known to provide transparent and reliable data, this data helps to derive highly reliable analysis results. However, public data sometimes does not reflect the latest situation, and may not include all types of cybercrime or the latest hacking techniques. In addition, this data alone can provide a limited perspective, unless combined with data from other sources.

7. Variables in the Dataset:
It shows statistics on occurrence and arrest by detailed type of cybercrime by year.
The number of cybercrime cases from 2014 to 2020 according to the types of cybercrime (hacking, denial of service, malicious programs, Internet fraud, cyber financial crimes, etc.).

8. Descriptive Statistics and Visualization:
The visualizations demonstrate fluctuations in hacking incidents, with a detailed breakdown by incident type in the second graph. The third graph shows overall clearance rates, revealing a peak year of high success. The subsequent graphs (fifth and sixth images) delve deeper into clearance rates by category, underscoring the successes and challenges in resolving various types of hacking incidents.

9. Statistical Analysis Model: 
The ARIMA model analysis predicts that the number of hacking incidents will continue along the historical mean. This stability in the model's forecast implies that while current cybersecurity measures may be managing the situation, they might not be significantly advancing the reduction of hacking incidents.

10. Results and Contribution:
The steady trend in hacking incidents calls for a proactive and adaptive approach in cybersecurity strategies. The lack of significant improvement in clearance rates despite the dynamic nature of hacking incidents highlights the need for a strategic review and enhancement of cyber defenses and law enforcement tactics. This analysis advocates for a data-driven approach to cybersecurity policymaking, which could serve as a cornerstone for developing more resilient and responsive systems to tackle the evolving cyber threats.
